# Daily_Horoscope
Daily_Horoscope scrapes your personal horoscope from https://www.ganeshaspeaks.com/ and displays it in the console.
For html document parsing I used the Jsoup library and apache commons library for some basic text editiing.

## Future plans are to give the application a UI and possibly create a web app.

## Libraries
Jsoup: https://jsoup.org/
Apache Commons: https://commons.apache.org/
